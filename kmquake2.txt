How To Run
------------------------------
	Unzip into your Quake2 directory (where quake2.exe is) and make a shortcut with path

	x\quake2\kmquake2.exe +set game gamedir (for singleplayer, LAN games, and net client use)

	where X is your Quake2 dir's parent dir (for example, C: or D:\games), and gamedir
	is the game subdirectory (if any) where the mod you want to run is.  NOTE: for the
	mod's code to run, it must be compiled into a kmq2gamex86.dll (see end of file for
	instructions).

	If you want to enable the playing of cinematics off the game or mission pack CD, add

	+set scanforcd 1

	to the command line.  This is disabled by default.

	An OpenGL 1.2 compatible 3D accelerator, OpenGL 1.4 support or higher (GeForce FX/Radeon 9500 or better) recommended.
	(Note: 3Dfx cards are NOT supported)
	Pentium III or Athlon 800MHz+
	At least 512MB of RAM (1 GB recommended) for 32-bit operating sytems, at least 2GB for 64-bit operating sytsems.

	If it crashes on startup, make sure that kmq2gamex86.dll is in the baseq2 subdir.

	If you experience lockups on an ATI video card, set entity shell type to solid or flowing
	in the advanced section of the video menu.  The envmap effect may be causing the lockups.

	If performance is too slow, or there are no visible or all black textures, type
	"exec lowend.cfg; vid_restart" in the console.  If you still get all-black
	textures, remove all config files from the game directory you are running in and restart.
	This will make KMQ2 fall back on the internal cvar defaults.

	It is strongly recommened that you copy the idlog.cin file from the Quake2 CD to your
	baseq2/video folder.  This will allow you to always open the menu before any demos start playing.
	
	To hear Ogg Vorbis tracks ingame, rip the Q2 CD's audio tracks (2-11) to track02-track11.ogg
	and put them in baseq2/music.  For the mission pack audio tracks, rip the Ground Zero CD's
	audio tracks (2-11) to track12-track21.ogg.  Don't bother ripping the tracks from the
	Reckoning CD, as they're a mix of the tracks on the Q2 and Ground Zero CDs.  Everything else
	will be taken care of internally by KMQuake2.

			MOD SUPPORT INSTRUCTIONS

=====================================================================================
To compile your mod for this modified engine, use the included game/q_shared.h
and game/game.h from the source release (Or you can just search for all my changes,
which are marked with my name, if you don't want to use GPLed headers.  Just don't
forget to include the #ifdef compiler directives around my changes).

Next, in g_save.c, change the assignment of the "maxentities" cvar from this:

maxentities = gi.cvar ("maxentities", "1024", CVAR_LATCH);

to this:

maxentities = gi.cvar ("maxentities", va("%i",MAX_EDICTS), CVAR_LATCH);

Then, change all references to modelindex 255 to MAX_MODELS-1 (for most mods,
p_client.c, p_view.c, and p_weapon.c are the only files that need changes).

Before compiling, make sure that this line in q_shared.h is uncommented:

#define	KMQUAKE2_ENGINE_MOD

You can revert your mod to compatibility with other engines by commenting out this line.

Finally, after compiling, rename the resulting gamex86.dll to kmq2gamex86.dll so
that the new engine will load it (don't overwrite your existing game DLL!).
